          <p>HTML and CSS are the two main part that make up a website. HTML makes the base website, it's like the foundation of a house and then CSS is the part that makes it look good so like carpet or the paint on the walls. Here are three ways they link.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>Inline is the easiest one to use if you are making a single page website. Inline is adding a style attribute to one element instead of changing the whole look of the page. Inline will have to be implemented to each element instead of controlling all elements from one CSS file
          </p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>
          Internal CSS is when the style attribute is added into the head element instead of being in the same line as the header or paragraph that you have made. Every Time you want to add a new style to a part of code you will need to add a new style instead of putting it in a new head element.
          </p>
            
          <br>
            
          <p>
             External CSS is when you create a new file in a folder (make sure you know where it is) you can call the file mystyle.css but make sure it is a .css file. All you have to do then is create all the lines of code for designs. 
          </p>
            
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col s12 m7">
      <h2 class="header"><a name="boxmodel">Box models for CSS.</a></h2>
    <div class="card horizontal">
      <div class="card-stacked">
        <div class="card-content">
          
          <p>Box models are the layout of the website which allows you to space things out add text in the center, left or right. You can add padding to make things stand out and add a border between different things. And you can add a margin to stop text and photos from going to the edge of the website.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>The content box is in the centre of the page between the margin, border and padding. The content is the stuff like text, photos and graphs.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>Padding is placed around the content to create and invisible barrier to stop text and photos colliding. </p>
            
          <br>
            
          <p>A border is placed around the padding which is around the content. The border adds a solid color so that it looks different. The border can just be a base color the same as the background or be a different color to make it look nicer.</p>
            
            <br>
          <p>The margin is a bit of code that clears a space around the area of the website. The margin is a clear area so makes no difference to the background.</p>

          <br>
          
          <p>Variables are something that will always change, depending on the program used and what software it is used for can be a very good add-on. A variable is something that holds a value an example of this is: 
<br>
var price1 = 5;
              <br>
var price2 = 6;
              <br>
var total = price1 + price2;
</p>
          
          <br>
          
            <p>Loops are continuous. In programming they are what they are called. They will repeat the process until there is a certain value met or the limit is reached.</p>
            
          <br>
            
          <p>Functions are used to create a sequence that a person has to carry out and to get a end result. Each button click is a function because you will get a result. An operating system is also a function because when click the start button or right click you get a result because the function has been completed.</p>
